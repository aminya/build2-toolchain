This is the build2 toolchain amalgamation. It includes the build system
(build2), package manager (bpkg), and their prerequisite libraries (libbutl
and libbpkg).

build2 is an open source, cross-platform toolchain for building and packaging
C++ code. Its aim is a modern build system and package manager for the C++
language that provide a consistent, out of the box interface across multiple
platforms and compilers. For more information see:

See the INSTALL file for the prerequisites and installation instructions.

See the doc/ directory for documentation.
