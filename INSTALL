The build2 toolchain requires a C++11 compiler with limited C++14 support. GCC
4.8 or later and Clang 3.4 or later are known to work. If you only need the
build2 build system without the bpkg package manager, then the C++ compiler is
all you will need. If, however, you would also like to build bpkg, then you
will first need to obtain SQLite as well as the libodb and libodb-sqlite
libraries.

In this guide we install everything that we build into /usr/local. If you would
like to use a different installation location, you will need to make
adjustments to the commands below.

Note on /usr/local: most distributions these days "cripple" this location by
either not searching /usr/local/include for headers during compilation (so we
add the -I option) or not searching /usr/local/lib for libraries either during
linking (so we add the -L option) or at runtime (which we fix with the help of
-rpath). If you know that your installation doesn't suffer from (some of) these
issues, then you can adjust the commands below accordingly. Note that even if
/usr/local/lib is searched at runtime, you may still have to run ldconfig(1)
(as root) after the installation to refresh the library cache.

1. Installing SQLite

    Skip this step if you are only interested in the build2 build system.

    To install SQLite, use your distribution's package manager and make sure
    you install both the libraries (most likely already installed) and the
    development files.

    For Debian/Ubuntu:

    $ sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev

    For RedHat/Fedora:

    $ sudo yum install sqlite-devel

    For FreeBSD:

    # pkg install sqlite3

2. Installing libodb and libodb-sqlite

    Again, skip this step if you are only interested in the build2 build
    system.

    [Currently we use pre-release versions of these libraries so they have to
    be built from source.]

    Download source packages for the two libraries from the same location as
    build2-toolchain. Then unpack, build, and install:

    $ cd libXXX-X.Y.Z
    $ ./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib \
      --prefix=/usr/local
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

    See the INSTALL file for each library for more information.

3. Bootstrapping build2

    The first step is to bootstrap the build2 build system:

    $ cd build2-toolchain-X.Y.Z
    $ cd build2/
    $ ./bootstrap
    $ ./build/b-boot config.bin.rpath=/usr/local/lib update

    For more information on this step (for example, how to specify the C++
    compiler to use, etc.) refer to the INSTALL file in the build2/
    subdirectory of build2-toolchain.

4. Configuring, Building, and Installing the Rest of the Toolchain

    $ cd .. # back to build2-toolchain-X.Y.Z

    $ ./build2/build/b                         \
      config.cxx.poptions=-I/usr/local/include \
      config.cxx.loptions=-L/usr/local/lib     \
      config.bin.rpath=/usr/local/lib          \
      config.install.root=/usr/local           \
      config.install.root.sudo=sudo            \
      configure

    $ ./build2/build/b update
    $ ./build2/build/b install

    To test the installation, run:

    $ which b
    $ b --version

    $ which bpkg
    $ bpkg --version

    $ cd # back to home directory

5. Setting up updates with the package manager

    If you only need to build this specific version of the toolchain, then you
    are done and can skip this step. However, if you are planning to upgrade to
    future versions, then going every time through the bootstrap steps will be
    tedious. Instead, we can use the bpkg package manager to manage upgrades
    automatically. Note also that without periodic upgrades your version of the
    toolchain may become too old to be able to upgrade itself. In this case you
    will have to fall back onto the bootstrap process.

    First, choose a directory where you would like bpkg to build everything,
    for example, build2-toolchain. Then:

    $ mkdir build2-toolchain
    $ cd build2-toolchain

    $ bpkg create                               \
      cxx                                       \
      config.cxx.poptions=-I/usr/local/include  \
      config.cxx.loptions=-L/usr/local/lib      \
      config.bin.rpath=/usr/local/lib           \
      config.install.root=/usr/local            \
      config.install.root.sudo=sudo

    $ bpkg add http://pkg.cppget.org/1/alpha
    $ bpkg fetch
    $ bpkg build build2 bpkg
    $ bpkg install build2 bpkg

    Later, to upgrade to new a new version of the toolchain, simply execute:

    $ bpkg fetch
    $ bpkg build build2 bpkg
    $ bpkg install build2 bpkg
